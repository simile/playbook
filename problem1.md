problem interview script
========================

//welcome
---

I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.

We are currently working on **a service for finding friends aftern moving to a new city.** The idea for the service was born after our founder moved to Austin and had a difficult time making meaninful friendships

Before we get too far along in the process of building a product, we want to make sure other “transplants” share this problem.

The interview is pretty straightforward, and I’ll begin by describing some problems we are tackling. Then, I’ll ask if any of those resonate with you.

I want to emphasize we do not have a finished product yet, and our objective is learning – we are not trying to sell or pitch anything. Sound like a plan?



// collect demographics - test customer segment

Before we get to the problems, I would like to learn a bit more about you.

* How old are you?

* What is your relationship status?

* Do you have any kids?

* Did you go to college? If so, where and what did you study?



// tell a story - set problem context
---

Awesome, thanks! So now, I am going to tell you more about the problems we are tackling.

When I moved to Austin, I had a few acquaintances but for the most part, I was completely alone.  I spent many Saturday nights alone on the couch with a bottle of wine and Netflix. I wanted to be out exploring Austin, but didn’t have anyone to do it with. This was kinda lonely.

I went to a few Meetups and networking events, but for the most part, talking to random strangers felt awkward and I had no way of knowing beforehand what type of people would show up.

Since I had no existing friends in Austin and didn’t start working right away, I had no one to vouch for me – to tell their friends I was cool, a little bit weird, but generally nice and worth hanging out with. In other words, I couldn’t even “join” an existing group because I had no “in.”

Does any of this resonate with you?


// problem ranking - test problem
---

I’d love it if you could rank the following for me, from most problematic to least:

1.  Is this your first time alone (or nearly alone) in a new city?
2.  Do you find it awkward to talk to strangers?
3.	Do you have anyone to vouch for you who could introduce you to new people?

Do you have any other feelings about making friends in a new city that I didn’t talk about?

So this is your first time alone in a new city. How does that make you feel? What are you currently doing to address or confront those feelings?

Talking to strangers is awkward. Is there anything you’ve found that makes it less awkward? Or any particular setting in which you feel more comfortable talking to new people?

It sucks not having at least one person who knows you and can vouch for you and introduce you to other people. How does that make you feel? Have you had a person like that in the past, or perhaps even been that person to someone else? Are you currently doing anything to try and meet that “first person?” What?

*explore new problems as they emerge*

// wrapping up - hook and ask
---

As I mentioned at the beginning, this isn’t a finished product, but we are building something that will make it easier to meet friends in a new city. The best way to describe the concept might be *“Tinder for friends”*

Based on the things we’ve discussed today, would you be willing to see the product when we have something ready?

We’re also looking to interview other people like you. Do you know anyone else who recently moved to a new city and has experienced similar frustrations meeting friends?
